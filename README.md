# SKIN CARE 

## Overview

This Arduino sketch is designed to be used with an Arduino board connected to a UV sensor for measuring UV index levels. It utilizes the Arduino IoT Cloud platform for monitoring and controlling the device remotely. The UV index readings are translated into Sun Protection Factor (SPF) recommendations, indicating the level of sunscreen protection needed.

## Setup

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the UV sensor to the Arduino board as per the hardware specifications.
2. **Arduino IoT Cloud Configuration**: Set up a Thing on the Arduino IoT Cloud platform and define the necessary variables (`sensorValue`, `spf`, `spfmsg`) for communication.
3. **Sketch Upload**: Upload the provided sketch (`UV_Sensor.ino`) to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.

## Operation

1. **Sensor Reading**: The UV sensor continuously measures UV index levels and sends the readings to the Arduino board.
2. **SPF Calculation**: Based on the UV index reading, the sketch calculates the appropriate SPF recommendation for sun protection.
3. **Cloud Communication**: The calculated SPF value and corresponding message are sent to the Arduino IoT Cloud for monitoring and control.
4. **Remote Monitoring**: Users can monitor the UV index readings and SPF recommendations remotely through the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard.

## Variables

- `sensorValue`: Represents the raw UV index reading from the sensor.
- `spf`: Indicates the calculated Sun Protection Factor based on the UV index reading.
- `spfmsg`: Provides a message corresponding to the SPF recommendation for sunscreen protection.
